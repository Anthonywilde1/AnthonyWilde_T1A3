# AnthonyWilde_T1A3

Welcome to my portfolio, please stay awhile and listen. There will be refreshments and finger food served momentarily. 

Website - https://anthonywilde1.github.io/AnthonyWilde_T1A3/

Repository - https://github.com/Anthonywilde1/AnthonyWilde_T1A3

Purpose - The purpose of this website was to demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS while also completing an assessment for CoderAcademy, 

Functionality/features - My sites includes capabilities for phones, tablets and computers. The site has a header/ nav bar that will scroll throughout the page with you which is useful for navigating the pages quickly on any device.  The portfolio has an introduction page with a picture of me on it, a contact page with 4 links (each one to a separate page), a Blog page (the blogs aren't actual blogs just place holder items) and a page listening my previous projects. I also had a link that downloads my resume.

Sitemap - The Site Map for this portfolio can be viewed inside of the SRC file and the slide deck file inside of that, under a png called site map (only do this if the pictures isnt right here).

Screenshots - 

Target audience - My target audience for this is adults of any ages/maturity, I think it creates a nice blend of formal/silliness, blending the two together. 

Tech stack (css, html, deployment etc) - The portfolio was created using my CSS and HTML skills, everything on the site is made using these 2 languages exclusively. I uploaded the work to GitHub to then have it deploy my website for everyone's viewing pleasure.
