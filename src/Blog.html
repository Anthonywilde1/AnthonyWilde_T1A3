            <h3>On The Mountains Of Madness</h3>
            <p>The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
                Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames
                and what do I get, for my pain?
                Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game.</p>

               <p> Even though I know--I suppose I'll show.
                All my cool and cold-like old job.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.</p>

               <p>Now I'm naked, nothing but an animal
                But can you fake it, for just one more show?
                And what do you want? I want to change.
                And what have you got?
                When you feel the same.</p>

                <p>Even though I know--I suppose I'll show.
                All my cool and cold-like old job.

                Tell me I'm the only one, tell me there's no other one.
                Jesus was an only son.
                Tell me I'm the chosen one.
                Jesus was an only son for you.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.

            <h3>Catcher In The Rye</h3>
            <p>I feel so unsure.
                As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
                As the music dies, something in your eyes,
                calls to mind the silver screen
                and all its sad good-byes.</p>

                <p>I'm never gonna dance again.
                Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
                Though it's easy to pretend,
                I know you're not a fool.
                Should've known better than to cheat a friend,
                and waste the chance that I'd been given.
                So I'm never gonna dance again,
                the way I danced with you.</p>

                <p>Time can never mend,
                the careless whispers of a good friend.
                To the heart and mind,
                ignorance is kind.
                There's no comfort in the truth,
                pain is all you'll find.</p>

                <p>I'm never gonna dance again,
                guilty feet have got no rhythm.
                Though it's easy to pretend,
                I know you're not a fool.
                I should've known better than to cheat a friend,
                and waste the chance that I'd been given.
                So I'm never gonna dance again,
                the way I danced with you.</p>

                <p>Never without your love,
                tonight the music seems so loud,
                I wish that we could lose this crowd.
                Maybe it's better this way,
                we'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say.
                We could have been so good together,
                we could have lived this dance forever.
                But no one's gonna dance with me,
                please stay.</p>

                <p>And I'm never gonna dance again,
                guilty feet have got no rhythm.
                Though it's easy to pretend,
                I know you're not a fool.
                Should've known better than to cheat a friend,
                and waste the chance that I'd been given.
                So I'm never gonna dance again,
                the way I danced with you.</p>

                <p>Now that you're gone.
                (Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong.
                That you had to leave me alone.</p>

            <h3>The Da Vinci Code </h3>
            <p>All the small things,
                true care truth brings,
                I'll take one lift,
                your ride, best trip. </p>

                <p>Always I know,
                you'll be at my show,
                watching, waiting
                commiserating.</p>

                turn the lights off, carry me home,

                work sucks, I know,
                she left me roses by the stairs,
                surprises let me know she cares.</p>

                turn the lights off, carry me home,
                keep your head still, I'll be your thrill,
                the night will go on, my little windmill.</p>

                <p>So, so you think you can tell
                Heaven from Hell
                Blue skies from pain?
                Can you tell a green field
                From a cold steel rail?
                A smile from a veil?
                Do you think you can tell?</p>

                <p>And did they get you to trade
                Your heroes for ghosts?
                Hot ashes for trees?
                Hot air for a cool breeze?
                Cold comfort for change?
                And did you exchange
                A walk on part in the war
                For a leading role in a cage?</p>

                <p>How I wish, how I wish you were here
                We're just two lost souls
                Swimming in a fish bowl year after year
                Running over the same old ground
                What have we found?
                The same old fears
                Wish you were here</p></div>

                Went down to Saint Tropez
                Where Renoir paints the walls
                Described you clearly
                But the sky began to fall
                Am I ever gonna see your face again
                Am I ever gonna see your face again</p>
                
                <p>Trams, cars and taxis
                Little waxworks on the move
                Carry young girls past me
                But none of them are you

                Am I ever gonna see your face again</p>
                
                <p>Without you near me
                I got no place to go
                Wait at the bar
                Maybe you might show
                Am I ever gonna see your face again
                Am I ever gonna see your face again</p>
                
                <p>I've got to stop these tears
                That's falling from my eye
                Go walk out in the rain
                So no one sees me cry
                Am I ever gonna see your face again
                Am I ever gonna see your face again
                Am I ever gonna see your face again

                <p>Can't stop the memory
                That goes climbing through my brain
                I get no answers
                So the questions still remains
