            <h3>On The Mountains Of Madness</h3>
            <p>The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
                Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames
                And what do I get, for my pain?
                Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game.
                Even though I know--I suppose I'll show.
                All my cool and cold-like old job.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Now I'm naked, nothing but an animal
                But can you fake it, for just one more show?
                And what do you want? I want to change.
                And what have you got?
                When you feel the same.
                Even though I know--I suppose I'll show
                All my cool and cold-like old job.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
                Tell me I'm the only one, tell me there's no other one.
                Jesus was an only son.
                Tell me I'm the chosen one.
                Jesus was an only son for you.
                Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.

                Jesus was an only son.
                And I still believe that I cannot be saved.
                And I still believe that I cannot be saved.
                And I still believe that I cannot be saved.
                And I still believe that I cannot be saved.</p>

            <h3>Catcher In The Rye</h3>
            <p>I feel so unsure.
                As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
                As the music dies, something in your eyes,
                Calls to mind the silver screen
                And all its sad good-byes.
                I'm never gonna dance again.
                Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
                Though it's easy to pretend.
                I know you're not a fool.
                Should've known better than to cheat a friend.
                And waste the chance that I'd been given.
                So I'm never gonna dance again.
                The way I danced with you.
                Time can never mend.
                The careless whispers of a good friend.
                To the heart and mind.
                Ignorance is kind.
                There's no comfort in the truth.
                Pain is all you'll find.
                I'm never gonna dance again.
                Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
                Though it's easy to pretend.
                I know you're not a fool.
                I should've known better than to cheat a friend.
                And waste the chance that I'd been given.
                So I'm never gonna dance again.
                The way I danced with you.
                Never without your love.
                Tonight the music seems so loud.
                I wish that we could lose this crowd.
                Maybe it's better this way.
                We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say.
                We could have been so good together.
                We could have lived this dance forever.
                But no one's gonna dance with me.
                Please stay.
                And I'm never gonna dance again.
                Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
                Though it's easy to pretend.
                I know you're not a fool.
                Should've known better than to cheat a friend.
                And waste the chance that I'd been given.
                So I'm never gonna dance again.
                The way I danced with you.
                Now that you're gone.
                (Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong.
                That you had to leave me alone.</p>
