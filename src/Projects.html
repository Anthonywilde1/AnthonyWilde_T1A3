            <p>This Project was my previous project for Coder Academy where we had to make a terminal app within the Ruby coding language. I created a text based adventure about myself. I think that given enough time I could come up with something better. But I was very happy with it when it was created</p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>This was a band webpage that I made in class as part of a challenge, we continued to add further content to it after the initial challenge. It is not at all made for phones, it was made solely on a monitor and before we were instructed to make for mobile first</p>
