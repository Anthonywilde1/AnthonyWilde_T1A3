A review of your development/build process including challenges, ethical issues, favourite parts, etc

Index - I liked the picture I went with it was great, infact i enjoyed taking all the pictures with my mum it lead to a fun afternoon and learned how to import files into my Virtual Machine which was interesting, I originally went with another photo for the intro but ended up choosing this one, the challenges I had involved making the nav bar the right size, as well as the photo. Luckily I could use the nav bar for other pages aswell. This page didnt deviate to much from the wire frame. Ethically i took the muppets song from youtube from someone who ripped the scene onto youtube. So i guess techincally i stole it but i stole it from someone who stole it and as we all know to negatives make a positive so I guess im okay?

Contact - Originally I had issues with fitting the imgs in this page to screen, if i had created this page again now I would have embeded the images and 'a' tags together for neatness and it would have made the a tags more responsive as if you look at them via inspect the a tags stretch out of the images they appear to be in. Ethical issues I faced for the photo for linked in is that I shook hands with my sister during lock down laws being in place and she doesn't live with us, I'm so sorry Mr Andrews please don't come after me.

Blog - I got to say the blog was probably the hardest time I had with this project but also the easiest. I forgot to put a display: grid at the start of the grid and so it did a regular flex box for the parent element, this was fine for the mobile design as this was the original design for the mobile so I was not aware of any errors at this point, I realised only half way through tablet setting after the design changes to what is more accurately shown in the wire frame for this page. My favourite part of this website is shown here though, the picture I took of my dog pippah, possibly the best picture I believe I have personally taken. As well as using song lyrics and book titles for my Lorem Ipsum because Latin sucks and making reference is a far more enjoyable experience.

Projects - Originally Projects was meant to run left to right but was changed almost immediately because of phones, the design of this page is rather basic. But I learned how to use 'a' tags better through projects, as well as navigate GitHub and created additional repo's to upload additional web pages to use for my Projects page.

Overall I definitely learned a lot through this assessment, like for example when to realise the work for the day has made me brain dead so I should call it quits. My fave part was doing the photos and wire frames and the part I disliked the most was making my website accessible for all devices.
